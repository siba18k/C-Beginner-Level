A comment is text that we put in our code to improve readability and maintainability. 

There are two common styles to write comments in C# programs: 

A single-line comment: prefix it with double slash: 
// This is a one-line comment 

A multi-line comment: use /* to start the comment and */ to finish it: 
/* My comment starts here 
 and finises here. 
*/

As a rule for clean coding, use comments only to explain whys, not whats. 
Don’t explain what the code is doing. Your code should be clean and self explanatory that doesn’t 
need a comment. 

But if you had a reason for writing the code that way, or there were 
constraints at the time you were working on this piece of code, always explain them 
using comments.  and straightforward that it doesn't need comment.
